# 🎵 Spotify Clone (HTML & CSS)

This project is a **static UI clone of the Spotify Web Player**, built entirely using **HTML5 and CSS3** as part of my web development learning journey. The primary objective of this project was to strengthen my understanding of **modern CSS layout techniques** and to practice creating visually accurate user interfaces without using JavaScript.

The clone closely resembles Spotify’s desktop web interface and focuses on layout, styling, spacing, and responsiveness rather than actual music playback functionality.


## Project Highlights

- Three-section layout:
  - Sidebar navigation
  - Main content area
  - Fixed bottom music player
- Flexbox-based layout for clean alignment and spacing
- Sticky top navigation bar using CSS
- Fixed bottom music player UI
- Custom-styled range sliders for playback progress and volume
- Hover effects, opacity transitions, and rounded UI elements
- Dark theme consistent with Spotify’s design language
- Responsive behavior using media queries


## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Semantic structure and layout
- **CSS3** – Flexbox, positioning, responsiveness, and UI styling
- **Font Awesome** – Icons
- **Google Fonts (Montserrat)** – Typography

> **Note:** This project does not use JavaScript.  
> It is a UI-only clone and does not include actual music playback.


## Features Implemented

- Sidebar navigation with Home, Search, and Library sections
- Sticky top navbar with action buttons
- Playlist and chart cards using reusable components
- Fixed bottom music player UI with control icons
- Custom progress bar and volume slider
- Responsive element hiding for smaller screens


## Learning Outcomes

This project helped me practice and understand:
- CSS Flexbox and layout structuring
- Positioning concepts (`fixed`, `sticky`, `relative`)
- Responsive design using media queries
- Building real-world UI clones
- Writing clean, modular, and reusable CSS


## Future Improvements

- Add interactivity using JavaScript (play/pause, progress control)
- Improve accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Optimize assets and folder structure
- Convert the UI into a React-based application
